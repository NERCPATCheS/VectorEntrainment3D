## Do not delete this folder path
Current file path in the `filepaths.xlsx` file will place output images from code run in this folder.  Two subfolders, `ParticlesFull` and `Matrix`, are created here during code run that will store images necessary for subsequent code runs.  These images are used to calculate 3D entrainment.

User can modify the `filepaths.xls` file to a different file structure; however, the user must run *STEP 1* code located in the `main.m` script file to update the `filepath.mat` file as well.
